*** TODO Define all zero operand opcodes :x86oids:
    These are any opcodes that have no operands (arguments), and do not do
    any special encoding inside the opcode. Some examples are things like
    NOP, WAIT, HLT (HALT), XLATB (all already defined).

    Right now the definitions have mostly been in
    [[file:src/arch/x86oids.lisp]], but it may be appropriate to eventually
    move this class of x86 instructions to its own file as I suspect there
    may be at least 20 or 30 that fit this class.

    Please try to be good with the documentation, XLATB to me is one of
    the better documented of the ones defined so far. HALT, WAIT, and NOP
    really don't have a chance for detailed docs in the way XLATB does
    (with the fancy lisp example), but the better documented the classes
    are, the better online assembler documentation will exist when this is
    done.
